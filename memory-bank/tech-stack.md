# Recommended Tech Stack

## Frontend
- **ThreeJS**: A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser. It’s perfect for your game because it’s relatively easy to use, well-documented, and widely supported. You can render your 3D city-like environment and simple player models (e.g., boxes or spheres) efficiently with it.
- **Colyseus Client**: Handles multiplayer communication with the backend. Colyseus is a framework designed for multiplayer games, and its client library connects to the server via WebSockets, keeping everything real-time and synchronized.
- **Hosting**: Deploy the frontend on a static hosting service like **Netlify** or **Vercel**. These platforms are simple to use, offer free tiers, and distribute your game globally via their content delivery networks (CDNs) for fast load times worldwide.

## Backend
- **Node.js**: A lightweight, event-driven runtime that’s great for real-time applications. It pairs well with JavaScript-based tools like ThreeJS and keeps your stack consistent.
- **Express.js**: A minimal web framework for Node.js to handle HTTP requests, such as user login or registration.
- **Colyseus**: Runs on the server to manage game rooms, player connections, and state synchronization over WebSockets. It simplifies multiplayer development by handling tasks like broadcasting game updates and managing player sessions.
- **Cannon.js**: A JavaScript physics engine to run on the server. It ensures the game has an authoritative state (e.g., player movements, collisions) to maintain fairness and prevent cheating.
- **Passport.js**: For secure user authentication. It’s easy to integrate with Node.js and Express.js, allowing players to log in and track their win/loss records.
- **Hosting**: Use a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) like **Heroku** or **Render.com**. Both support Node.js and WebSockets, offer free tiers for small projects, and make deployment straightforward without needing advanced server management.

## Database
- **MongoDB Atlas**: A managed MongoDB service for storing persistent data like user accounts and game stats. It integrates seamlessly with Node.js, has a free tier, and eliminates the need to manage your own database server.

## Why This Stack?
- **Simplicity**: Everything runs on JavaScript, so you’re using one language across the frontend and backend. ThreeJS is beginner-friendly for 3D, and Colyseus abstracts away much of the complexity of multiplayer networking. Hosting options like Netlify and Heroku require minimal setup.
- **Robustness**: WebSockets (via Colyseus) ensure low-latency, real-time communication for multiplayer gameplay. The server-side physics with Cannon.js and game logic with Colyseus create an authoritative setup, preventing cheating—a must for a competitive game. MongoDB Atlas provides reliable storage for user data.
- **Worldwide Reach**: Netlify or Vercel’s CDN ensures fast frontend delivery globally, while Heroku or Render.com can host your backend with WebSocket support. Starting with a single server is fine, and you can scale later if needed.
- **Leverages Your Suggestions**: ThreeJS handles the 3D rendering you asked about, and WebSockets (via Colyseus) deliver the real-time multiplayer functionality you mentioned.

## How It Works Together
- **Frontend**: Players load the game in their browsers via Netlify or Vercel. ThreeJS renders the 3D world, and the Colyseus client connects them to the backend over WebSockets.
- **Backend**: Node.js runs on Heroku or Render.com, using Express.js for authentication (via Passport.js) and Colyseus for game logic. Cannon.js simulates physics on the server, processing player inputs and updating the game state, which is then sent to all connected clients.
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas stores user accounts and stats, accessed by the backend for login and record-keeping.

## Getting Started
- **Frontend**: Write your game in ThreeJS, use simple shapes for assets (e.g., boxes for buildings), and connect to the backend with the Colyseus client. Deploy to Netlify with a `git push`.
- **Backend**: Set up a Node.js project with Express.js, Passport.js for login, Colyseus for multiplayer rooms, and Cannon.js for physics. Deploy to Heroku or Render.com.
- **Database**: Sign up for MongoDB Atlas, create a free cluster, and connect it to your backend for user data storage.
