# Zombies vs Humans - Progress Log

## March 19, 2023

### Step 1: Project Structure Setup

- Created the main project directory `zombies-vs-humans`
- Set up subdirectories following the modular architecture principle:
  - `client/`: Will contain all frontend ThreeJS code and assets
  - `server/`: Will contain Colyseus server, game logic, and backend code
  - `shared/`: Will contain schema definitions and utilities shared between client and server
- Initialized a Node.js project in the root with `npm init -y`
- Generated package.json with default configuration

All tests passed for Step 1:
- Verified folder structure exists with client/, server/, and shared/ directories
- Confirmed package.json is present in the root directory

The setup enforces the modular architecture principle from Cursor Rule #1, keeping frontend and backend code properly separated while allowing shared schemas through the shared directory.
