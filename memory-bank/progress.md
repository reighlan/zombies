# Zombies vs Humans - Progress Log

## March 19, 2023

### Step 1: Project Structure Setup

- Created the main project directory `zombies-vs-humans`
- Set up subdirectories following the modular architecture principle:
  - `client/`: Will contain all frontend ThreeJS code and assets
  - `server/`: Will contain Colyseus server, game logic, and backend code
  - `shared/`: Will contain schema definitions and utilities shared between client and server
- Initialized a Node.js project in the root with `npm init -y`
- Generated package.json with default configuration

All tests passed for Step 1:
- Verified folder structure exists with client/, server/, and shared/ directories
- Confirmed package.json is present in the root directory

The setup enforces the modular architecture principle from Cursor Rule #1, keeping frontend and backend code properly separated while allowing shared schemas through the shared directory.

### Step 2: Install Core Dependencies

- Installed the following core dependencies:
  - `three`: ThreeJS library for 3D graphics rendering
  - `colyseus.js`: Client library for Colyseus multiplayer framework
  - `express`: Web server framework for Node.js
  - `colyseus`: Server-side multiplayer game framework
  - `cannon-es`: Physics engine for collision detection

All tests passed for Step 2:
- Verified all required packages were installed successfully
- Installed versions:
  - three@0.174.0
  - colyseus.js@0.16.11
  - colyseus@0.16.3
  - express@4.21.2
  - cannon-es@0.20.0

Note: There was a warning about Colyseus requiring Node.js 20.x while the current version is 18.17.1. This should be monitored if any compatibility issues arise.

### Step 3: Set Up Basic Server with Colyseus

- Created `server/index.js` with a basic Node.js server configuration:
  - Set up Express app for HTTP handling
  - Created an HTTP server
  - Initialized Colyseus server using the HTTP server
  - Defined an empty `GameRoom` class extending Colyseus.Room with basic handlers:
    - `onCreate`: Logs when a room is created
    - `onJoin`: Logs when a client joins
    - `onLeave`: Logs when a client leaves
    - `onMessage`: Logs received messages
  - Registered the `GameRoom` class as "game_room" in Colyseus
  - Added middleware to serve static files from the client directory
  - Configured the server to listen on port 2567

All tests passed for Step 3:
- Server starts without crashing
- Successfully logs "Server running on port 2567" to the console
- Properly initializes the Colyseus server and registers the game room

The implementation follows Cursor Rule #2, leveraging Colyseus for multiplayer networking with explicit handler methods for different connection events.

### Step 4: Define Player State Schema

- Created `shared/PlayerSchema.js` with a Colyseus schema for player data:
  - Used `@colyseus/schema` for efficient state synchronization
  - Defined the following properties:
    - `x` (number): Player's x-coordinate position
    - `z` (number): Player's z-coordinate position
    - `team` (string): Player's team ("human" or "zombie")
    - `id` (string): Unique player identifier
  - Set default values in the constructor
  - Added proper JSDoc documentation

- Tested the schema by:
  - Importing it in `server/index.js`
  - Creating a test instance with sample values
  - Logging the instance to verify structure

All tests passed for Step 4:
- Successfully imported the schema in server/index.js
- Console output confirms the schema has the expected properties
- Schema structure matches the requirements with proper typing

The schema will enable efficient state synchronization between server and clients, transmitting only the data that changes rather than the entire game state.
