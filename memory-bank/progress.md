# Zombies vs Humans - Progress Log

## March 19, 2023

### Step 1: Project Structure Setup

- Created the main project directory `zombies-vs-humans`
- Set up subdirectories following the modular architecture principle:
  - `client/`: Will contain all frontend ThreeJS code and assets
  - `server/`: Will contain Colyseus server, game logic, and backend code
  - `shared/`: Will contain schema definitions and utilities shared between client and server
- Initialized a Node.js project in the root with `npm init -y`
- Generated package.json with default configuration

All tests passed for Step 1:
- Verified folder structure exists with client/, server/, and shared/ directories
- Confirmed package.json is present in the root directory

The setup enforces the modular architecture principle from Cursor Rule #1, keeping frontend and backend code properly separated while allowing shared schemas through the shared directory.

### Step 2: Install Core Dependencies

- Installed the following core dependencies:
  - `three`: ThreeJS library for 3D graphics rendering
  - `colyseus.js`: Client library for Colyseus multiplayer framework
  - `express`: Web server framework for Node.js
  - `colyseus`: Server-side multiplayer game framework
  - `cannon-es`: Physics engine for collision detection

All tests passed for Step 2:
- Verified all required packages were installed successfully
- Installed versions:
  - three@0.174.0
  - colyseus.js@0.16.11
  - colyseus@0.16.3
  - express@4.21.2
  - cannon-es@0.20.0

Note: There was a warning about Colyseus requiring Node.js 20.x while the current version is 18.17.1. This should be monitored if any compatibility issues arise.

### Step 3: Set Up Basic Server with Colyseus

- Created `server/index.js` with a basic Node.js server configuration:
  - Set up Express app for HTTP handling
  - Created an HTTP server
  - Initialized Colyseus server using the HTTP server
  - Defined an empty `GameRoom` class extending Colyseus.Room with basic handlers:
    - `onCreate`: Logs when a room is created
    - `onJoin`: Logs when a client joins
    - `onLeave`: Logs when a client leaves
    - `onMessage`: Logs received messages
  - Registered the `GameRoom` class as "game_room" in Colyseus
  - Added middleware to serve static files from the client directory
  - Configured the server to listen on port 2567

All tests passed for Step 3:
- Server starts without crashing
- Successfully logs "Server running on port 2567" to the console
- Properly initializes the Colyseus server and registers the game room

The implementation follows Cursor Rule #2, leveraging Colyseus for multiplayer networking with explicit handler methods for different connection events.

### Step 4: Define Player State Schema

- Created `shared/PlayerSchema.js` with a Colyseus schema for player data:
  - Used `@colyseus/schema` for efficient state synchronization
  - Defined the following properties:
    - `x` (number): Player's x-coordinate position
    - `z` (number): Player's z-coordinate position
    - `team` (string): Player's team ("human" or "zombie")
    - `id` (string): Unique player identifier
  - Set default values in the constructor
  - Added proper JSDoc documentation

- Tested the schema by:
  - Importing it in `server/index.js`
  - Creating a test instance with sample values
  - Logging the instance to verify structure

All tests passed for Step 4:
- Successfully imported the schema in server/index.js
- Console output confirms the schema has the expected properties
- Schema structure matches the requirements with proper typing

The schema will enable efficient state synchronization between server and clients, transmitting only the data that changes rather than the entire game state.

### Step 5: Create Game Room Logic

- Created `server/GameRoom.js` with a full Colyseus room implementation:
  - Defined a `GameState` class using Colyseus Schema:
    - Added a `players` property using MapSchema to store player instances
    - Set up proper type definitions for schema serialization
  - Created a complete `GameRoom` class with all required handlers:
    - `onCreate`: Initializes room state with a new GameState instance
    - `onJoin`: Adds players to the state with unique IDs and default positions
    - `onLeave`: Removes players from the state when they disconnect
    - `onMessage`: Handles incoming messages from clients
  - Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation following the docs rule

- Updated `server/index.js` to:
  - Import and use the external GameRoom class
  - Remove the inline GameRoom definition
  - Maintain the same room registration with Colyseus

- Created a test client in `client/test-client.html`:
  - Added a simple UI for testing room connections
  - Implemented connection/disconnection functionality
  - Added player list display to visualize connected players
  - Used Colyseus.js client to connect to the server
  - Added event listeners for state changes

All tests passed for Step 5:
- Server starts successfully with the new GameRoom implementation
- Multiple browser tabs can connect to the room simultaneously
- Each player gets a unique ID and appears in the players list
- When a player disconnects, they are properly removed from the state

The implementation fully satisfies Cursor Rule #2, using Colyseus for real-time multiplayer with explicit event handlers for all room operations.

### Step 6: Set Up Basic Client HTML

- Created `client/index.html` with a clean, minimal structure:
  - Added a `<canvas>` element with id "gameCanvas" for ThreeJS rendering
  - Set up basic CSS styling to make the canvas fill the entire viewport
  - Added a `<script>` tag to load `main.js`
  - Removed the test client UI (preserved in `client/test-client.html`)

- Created a minimal `client/main.js` file:
  - Added a simple console log to verify the script loads correctly
  - Will be expanded in Step 7 to include ThreeJS scene setup

All tests passed for Step 6:
- The HTML file loads successfully in the browser
- The canvas element appears and fills the viewport
- The main.js file loads and logs its message to the console
- No errors appear in the browser console

This setup prepares the client for ThreeJS integration, following a clean separation between HTML structure and JavaScript functionality. The canvas provides the rendering target for all 3D graphics in the game.

### Step 7: Initialize ThreeJS Scene

- Enhanced `client/main.js` with a complete ThreeJS setup:
  - Added proper JSDoc documentation for all functions and the file itself
  - Set up ES6 module imports using ThreeJS from a CDN
  - Implemented the following core functions:
    - `initScene()`: Creates the scene, camera, and renderer
    - `createGround()`: Creates a 10x10 unit green plane at y=0
    - `handleResize()`: Maintains proper aspect ratio on window resize
    - `animate()`: Sets up the animation loop for rendering
    - `init()`: Coordinates initialization and starts the render loop

- Updated `client/index.html` to support ES6 modules:
  - Changed the script tag to `type="module"` for ES6 import syntax
  
All tests passed for Step 7:
- The ThreeJS scene initializes successfully
- A green 10x10 plane appears on the screen at y=0
- The camera is positioned to view the plane from above and at a distance
- The scene renders without errors in the console
- The canvas resizes appropriately when the browser window changes size

The implementation provides a solid foundation for the game's visual aspects, with a clean modular structure and comprehensive documentation following the docs rule. The scene is now ready for adding player representations and game elements in future steps.

### Step 8: Connect Client to Server (Revised)

- Fixed the Colyseus client integration with the following changes:
  - Updated `client/index.html` to load Colyseus in the head section:
    - Used a specific version (0.14.13) for compatibility
    - Ensured the library loads before any other scripts
    - Added a debug overlay to display connection status
  
  - Enhanced `client/main.js` with robust connection handling:
    - Added proper JSDoc type annotations for Colyseus objects
    - Explicitly used the global `window.Colyseus` object for reliability
    - Added error checking to verify Colyseus is available
    - Implemented comprehensive error handling and status updates
    - Created an updateDebug function to display connection status

  - Created `client/colyseus-test.html` as a standalone connection testing tool:
    - Simple UI for testing Colyseus connectivity independently
    - Detailed logging of connection events and state updates
    - Manual connect/disconnect functionality
    - Helpful for debugging connection issues

All tests passed for Step 8:
- Server logs show client connections when the game page loads
- The client successfully connects to the Colyseus server
- The debug overlay displays the connection status and player ID
- No "Colyseus is not defined" errors appear in the console
- The ThreeJS scene continues to render correctly during connection

This implementation properly integrates the client-side ThreeJS rendering with the Colyseus multiplayer backend. The separation between the rendering engine and networking code follows good modular design principles, with proper error handling and diagnostic capabilities for troubleshooting.

### Step 9: Render Players as Cubes

- Enhanced `client/main.js` with player rendering capabilities:
  - Added a `playerMeshes` Map to track 3D objects for each player
  - Implemented player cube rendering functions:
    - `createOrUpdatePlayerMesh()`: Creates or updates a player's 3D representation
    - `removePlayerMesh()`: Removes a player's 3D object when they disconnect
    - `updatePlayerMeshes()`: Updates all player meshes based on the current state
  - Set cube colors based on team: human players are red, zombie players are green
  - Positioned cubes at the player's x, z coordinates with y=0.5 (on top of the ground)
  - Added handling for team changes by updating cube colors

- Modified `server/GameRoom.js` to handle team assignments:
  - Updated the `onJoin` method to assign teams for testing:
    - First player to join is assigned to the "human" team
    - Subsequent players are assigned to the "zombie" team
  - Added more detailed logging of player team assignments

All tests passed for Step 9:
- When two browser tabs connect to the server, they show different colored cubes:
  - The first connection shows a red cube (human)
  - The second connection shows a green cube (zombie)
- Player cubes appear at the correct position (0, 0) on the ground plane
- Player cubes are properly removed when connections are closed
- Console logs show the correct team assignments and mesh creation

This implementation enables visual representation of players based on their team, following the cursor rule for server-side authority while providing real-time visual feedback to the player. The system is ready for adding movement in the next step.

### Step 10: Implement Basic Movement

- Enhanced `client/main.js` with keyboard controls for player movement:
  - Added key state tracking for WASD keys
  - Implemented movement variables and constants:
    - `MOVEMENT_SPEED`: Controls how quickly players move
    - `MOVEMENT_UPDATE_RATE`: Limits how frequently position updates are sent to the server
  - Created new functions for movement:
    - `setupMovementControls()`: Sets up keyboard event listeners
    - `updatePlayerPosition()`: Calculates movement based on key states and sends updates to server
  - Updated the animation loop to include movement updates
  - Added bounds checking to keep players within the ground plane
  - Implemented rate limiting to prevent flooding the server with updates

- Updated `server/GameRoom.js` to handle movement messages:
  - Enhanced the `onMessage` method to process 'move' message type
  - Added server-side position updates for players
  - Implemented server-side logging of player movements
  - Ensured the server remains the authority for player positions

All tests passed for Step 10:
- Players can be controlled using WASD keys
- Movement is properly synchronized across multiple browser tabs
- Movement updates are sent to the server and broadcast to all clients
- Player positions remain consistent between different clients
- Players stay within the boundaries of the ground plane
- Movement feels responsive while maintaining network efficiency

This implementation follows the server authority principle by having the server validate and broadcast all position updates. The client sends movement intentions, but the actual position updates are handled authoritatively by the server, which prevents cheating while maintaining responsive gameplay.

### Step 11: Add Server-Side Physics Check

- Enhanced `server/GameRoom.js` with collision detection:
  - Added a simulation interval that runs collision checks every 50ms
  - Implemented collision detection functions:
    - `calculateDistance()`: Calculates the Euclidean distance between two players
    - `checkCollisions()`: Identifies all humans and zombies and checks for collisions
  - Added team change logic when collisions occur:
    - When a zombie gets within 1 unit of a human, the human is turned into a zombie
    - The human's team property is updated, which automatically propagates to all clients
    - Added detailed logging of infection events
  - Added immediate collision checking after player movement:
    - When a player moves, collision detection runs immediately
    - This provides responsive feedback when a zombie catches a human
  - Added game over detection for when all players become zombies

- Used a simple distance-based collision system:
  - Calculated distance using the Pythagorean theorem (sqrt(dx² + dz²))
  - Collision threshold set at 1.0 unit to match the cube size
  - The collision check is efficient and scales with the number of players

No additional client-side changes were needed since:
  - The state synchronization from Step 8 already propagates team changes
  - The cube color update logic from Step 9 automatically reflects team changes

All tests passed for Step 11:
- When a zombie player moves close to a human player, the human turns into a zombie
- The human player's cube changes from red to green in all connected clients
- The server logs show "Collision detected!" messages with player IDs
- The transformation happens immediately when players get within 1 unit
- The collision system works with multiple players and handles chain reactions

This implementation follows Cursor Rule #3 for server-side physics, ensuring that all collision detection and team changes are handled authoritatively by the server. The distance-based approach provides a simple yet effective collision system that supports the core game mechanic of zombies converting humans.
