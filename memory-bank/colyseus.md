To implement the Zombies vs Humans game using Colyseus for real-time multiplayer functionality, I’ll leverage specific Colyseus patterns for room management, state synchronization, and message handling. Below, I detail how each aspect will be addressed to create a functional base game where humans try to survive for 5 minutes against zombies who can turn them by getting close.
Room Management
Room management in Colyseus involves creating and managing game sessions as separate rooms, allowing multiple games to run concurrently. Here’s how I’ll implement it:
Custom Room Class: Define a GameRoom class extending Colyseus.Room. This class will encapsulate all game logic for a single session.
onCreate: Initialize the game state when the room is created. Set up an empty player map and a game timer starting at 300 seconds (5 minutes). The state will also include a gameStatus property, initially set to "playing".
onJoin: Handle new player connections. Add each player to the game state with a unique ID, a default position (e.g., (0, 0, 0)), and assign them to either the human or zombie team based on team balancing logic (detailed below). Start the timer when the second player joins, ensuring the game begins with at least two players as per the game design document (GDD).
onLeave: Remove a player from the game state when they disconnect. The game continues with remaining players, and win conditions adjust naturally (e.g., if no humans remain, zombies win).
Team Balancing: In onJoin, assign players to teams to maintain balance. Track the number of humans (numHumans) and zombies (numZombies). If numHumans <= numZombies, assign the new player to humans; otherwise, assign to zombies. This ensures teams start as evenly as possible.
Handling Disconnections: Colyseus provides built-in support for managing disconnections. If a player leaves, their removal from the state is handled in onLeave, and the game proceeds unless fewer than two players remain, though for simplicity, I’ll let it run until win conditions are met.
State Synchronization
State synchronization ensures all clients have a consistent view of the game world. Colyseus’ schema-based system optimizes this by syncing only changed data. Here’s the implementation:
Game State Schema: Define the game state using Colyseus’ Schema system for efficient serialization and synchronization:
Players: A MapSchema of player objects, where each player has properties like:
id: Unique identifier.
position: (x, y, z) coordinates.
team: "human" or "zombie".
Timer: A number representing remaining seconds (starts at 300).
gameStatus: A string ("playing", "humans won", or "zombies won") to track the game’s state.
Automatic Synchronization: Colyseus automatically broadcasts state changes to all clients when the state is modified on the server. For example:
When a player moves, update their position in the MapSchema, and only that change is sent.
When a human is turned into a zombie, update their team, triggering a sync of that property.
Server Authority: The server is authoritative, validating all actions (e.g., movement, team changes) and updating the state. Clients render the state received from the server, ensuring fairness and preventing cheating.
Simulation Loop: Use setSimulationInterval to update the state periodically (e.g., 20 Hz). In each tick:
Decrement the timer.
Check for zombie-human collisions (if a zombie is within 1 unit of a human, change the human’s team to "zombie").
Evaluate win conditions:
If numHumans == 0, set gameStatus to "zombies won".
If timer <= 0 and numHumans > 0, set gameStatus to "humans won".
Message Handling
Message handling facilitates communication between clients and the server for player actions. Here’s how it’s implemented:
Message Types: Define specific message types for player inputs, such as:
"move": Contains direction data (e.g., { dx, dy, dz }) to update the player’s position.
onMessage Handler: In the GameRoom class, implement the onMessage method to process incoming messages:
For a "move" message:
Receive the direction data from the client.
Validate the move (e.g., ensure it’s within reasonable bounds, though the base game assumes an open plane with no obstacles).
Update the player’s position in the state (e.g., player.position.x += dx).
The updated state is automatically synced to all clients.
Server-Side Validation: All actions are validated on the server. For example, movement is only applied if the input is legitimate, ensuring consistency and security.
Broadcasting Events: When the game ends (via win conditions), broadcast a message to all clients with the result (e.g., { type: "gameOver", winner: "humans" }). Clients use this to display the outcome.
Additional Considerations
Client-Side Prediction: On the client, implement prediction for the local player’s movement. When a movement key is pressed, update the local position immediately for responsiveness, then reconcile with the server’s state when it arrives. This reduces perceived latency.
Game World: For the base game, use an open plane with no obstacles or items, as special features like buildings or the Flower of Life are deferred to later updates.
Win Conditions: Clarified from the GDD:
Zombies win if all humans are turned (numHumans == 0).
Humans win if the timer reaches zero with at least one human alive (timer <= 0 && numHumans > 0).
Summary of Colyseus Patterns
Room Management: Custom GameRoom class with onCreate, onJoin, onLeave handlers; team balancing in onJoin.
State Synchronization: Schema-based state with a MapSchema for players, a timer, and gameStatus; automatic syncing via Colyseus; server-driven updates at 20 Hz.
Message Handling: "move" messages processed in onMessage with server validation; game-over broadcasts.
This implementation provides a solid foundation for the base Zombies vs Humans game, with room for future expansion (e.g., items, obstacles) by extending the state and logic as needed.
