# Your rule content
**Rule:** Use MongoDB for persistent data (e.g., player stats) and leverage cursors to fetch large datasets in batches, avoiding full memory loads.

**Implementation:** Define a `.cursor/rules/database.md` rule for `db/**/*.js` to encourage cursor usage and indexing.

**Why:** Efficient data handling reduces memory overhead and speeds up queries, vital for scalability.
