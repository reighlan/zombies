## 2. Leverage Colyseus for Networking
**Rule:** Use Colyseus to manage real-time multiplayer features. Define game rooms with explicit `onJoin`, `onLeave`, and `onMessage` handlers to streamline player interactions.

**Implementation:** Create a rule in `.cursor/rules/networking.md` with `@file` references to Colyseus schema files for context.

**Why:** Colyseus ensures efficient state synchronization and low-latency communication, critical for multiplayer games.
