Modular Architecture Over Monoliths
Rule: Structure your codebase into multiple, small, focused modules (e.g., separate files for player movement, rendering, networking) instead of a single giant file. Store these in logical directories like src/networking/ or src/rendering/.

Implementation: Use Cursor’s project rules in .cursor/rules with glob patterns (e.g., src/**/*.js) to enforce modular conventions per directory.

Why: Modularity improves readability, debugging, and scalability, preventing the chaos of a monolithic file that’s hard to maintain.
